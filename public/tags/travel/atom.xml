        <content type="html" xml:base="https://github.com/solankybasant/travel/coastal-karnataka/">&lt;p&gt;Every now and then, we all crave an escape from the humdrum of our daily lives. The call to pack our bags, hit the open road, and drive until the city skyline becomes a distant memory can be irresistible. This time, my heart was set on Udupi. I had never been there before, but tales of relaxing vacations from folks who’ve been there definitely piqued my interest. I longed for a holiday away from the pressure of ticking off Instagram-worthy locations—a vacation that was genuinely restful.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;iframe src=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.google.com&#x2F;maps&#x2F;d&#x2F;embed?mid=1O5OCS2JhyS1ioyAfBwGLl5rA0OAj0wA&amp;ehbc=2E312F&quot; width=&quot;640&quot; height=&quot;480&quot;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bengaluru to Udupi is approximately a 400 km journey. Upholding the tradition of early morning departures for long road trips, I started my drive at 6:30 am. My first stop was Vaishali, renowned for its chicken dishes. As it was early and a long drive lay ahead, I opted for a lighter breakfast—a delicious Masala dosa and a filter coffee.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
    &lt;img src=&quot;&amp;#x2F;images&amp;#x2F;travel&amp;#x2F;ka23&amp;#x2F;coastal-karnataka-1.png&quot; alt=&quot;Hotel Vaishali - Masala dosa&quot;&gt;
    &lt;figcaption&gt;Hotel Vaishali - Masala dosa&lt;&#x2F;figcaption&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While Udupi is only 400 km away, the trip can take up to 8 hours due to the challenging Ghats section. My route led me through Agumbe Ghats, filled with sharp hairpin bends and narrow roads, offering a fun and adventurous driving experience.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
    &lt;img src=&quot;&amp;#x2F;images&amp;#x2F;travel&amp;#x2F;ka23&amp;#x2F;coastal-karnataka-2.png&quot; alt=&quot;Chai break&quot;&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I arrived in Udupi around 3 pm and refreshed myself at my picturesque Airbnb accommodation, located right next to the beautiful Suvarna river.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This Airbnb was located in Mavin Kundru, a village comprising several islands locally referred to as ‘Kudru.’ The backyards of most houses were filled with coconut plantations—presumably because the salty river water precluded growing anything else. My Airbnb host introduced me to some nuances of village life. For instance, the absence of garbage collection systems led the locals to burn waste in mud pits. The salty river water, though abundant, was unusable, forcing the villagers to rely on well water.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite the rural setting, my Airbnb was quite comfortable, offering all the amenities one could need, albeit with somewhat isolating and darker nights.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here’s a video snippet of me driving through this charming village:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Udupi is famous for its beaches, with Malpe being the most crowded one. I took a leisurely drive on a 7 km scenic beach road stretch from Mattu to Padukere Beach, flanked by palm trees and views of the river on one side and the Arabian Sea on the other.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Exploring was fun, but it was time to delve into some Mangalorean cuisine. Believe me, Udupi’s food is a culinary revelation, offering excellent options for both vegetarians and non-vegetarians.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I sampled the iconic dosas at MTR and Pai Tiffin, though the latter is more renowned for its Puris. Another delightful find was the Mangalore Buns, a local specialty I thoroughly enjoyed.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks to the wonderful recommendations by &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;SathyaBhat&quot;&gt;Sathya&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;joshenoy&quot;&gt;Jo&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;, I tried several popular restaurants.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My seafood cravings led me to Hotel Thimmappa. Despite being a weekday afternoon, this place was bustling with a mostly local crowd. The ambiance was modest, but the fish curry and rice were beyond amazing.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
    &lt;img src=&quot;&amp;#x2F;images&amp;#x2F;travel&amp;#x2F;ka23&amp;#x2F;coastal-karnataka-13.png&quot; alt=&quot;Pomfret Fish&quot;&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hotel Woodlands was another frequent visit, given its versatile menu catering to various cuisines.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
    &lt;img src=&quot;&amp;#x2F;images&amp;#x2F;travel&amp;#x2F;ka23&amp;#x2F;coastal-karnataka-14.png&quot; alt=&quot;Bread Masala&quot;&gt;

    &lt;figcaption&gt;Gudbud&lt;&#x2F;figcaption&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My last day in Udupi was dedicated to indulging in more seafood. I headed to Machali (original branch in Mangalore). The crowd here was even larger than Thimmappa, but after a 20-minute wait, I was ready to enjoy a feast of Calamari, Anjal, and Neer Dosa!&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
    &lt;img src=&quot;&amp;#x2F;images&amp;#x2F;travel&amp;#x2F;ka23&amp;#x2F;coastal-karnataka-16.png&quot; alt=&quot;Neer dosa and Anjal Masala Fry&quot;&gt;

&lt;&#x2F;figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On my final day in Udupi, the typically hot weather gave way to an unexpected change. The sky was adorned with clouds, offering a pleasant respite.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
    &lt;img src=&quot;&amp;#x2F;images&amp;#x2F;travel&amp;#x2F;ka23&amp;#x2F;coastal-karnataka-18.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Initially, I hadn’t planned on visiting Goa, but I was eager to continue my drive along the beautiful coastline of Karnataka. My extended journey covered approximately 300 km, taking me through Murdeshwar, Gokarna, and Karwar, before finally reaching Goa.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My stay in Goa was near Colva Beach in South Goa, a place I had visited multiple times. I enjoyed familiar favorites like dining at Martin’s, sipping beers at a beach shack, and soaking in the laid-back Susegad life.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Returning home from Goa, I embarked on a 600-kilometer drive. The Panjim-Belgaum stretch, particularly, was a feast for the eyes. The previous night’s rainfall had washed the roads clean. Perfect time to roll down windows!&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;

    &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;&#x2F;figcaption&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It had been a joyous journey where I allowed myself to relax, soak in the experience, and enjoy the drive through varied landscapes—ghats, rivers, beaches, and lush forests. I fell in love with Mangalorean food and the warmth of Udupi’s people. This trip wasn’t just a road trip—it was a serene experience I’d cherish and one that I hope to repeat soon.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

        <id>https://github.com/solankybasant/travel/solo-trip-dharamshala/</id>
        
        <content type="html" xml:base="https://github.com/solankybasant/travel/solo-trip-dharamshala/">&lt;p&gt;It’s been a year since I last made a solo trip to Manali, and I’d been getting restless at home. I’d wanted to make a long-ish trip with my car for quite some time now, and the heat of North India started to take a toll on me. I’ve made quite a few trips by myself and with friends, and I don’t necessarily prefer one over the other. Both have varied experiences, but this time I was definitely itching to go somewhere quiet, where I could get the most driving pleasure. And so I chose, Naddi, a village near Dharamshala. It’s about a 20 mins drive from the very touristy McLeodGanj (Upper Dharamshala). I’d found a lovely guesthouse via Airbnb and booked it after talking to the hosts.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Started the trip early morning at 5:45 from my place in Faridabad. Although that isn’t relatively early to start, I was able to make decent progress before the city woke up. I’ve travelled quite a few times on this highway (Panipat - Karnal - Ambala), and I prefer to stop at Haldiram’s at CHD Developers Daana Paani for breakfast.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;&#x2F;images&#x2F;travel&#x2F;hp22&#x2F;1.png&quot; alt=&quot;image&quot; &#x2F;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;&#x2F;images&#x2F;travel&#x2F;hp22&#x2F;2.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;image&quot; &#x2F;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Energised me with a good breakfast and some masala chai (my favourite thing while travelling). I floored the pedal (not literally, there are police patrolling vehicles throughout NH-44) and made good progress till Ambala. The fun part of the road trip starts now, with wide roads traversing the state of Punjab. Sprawling large sunflower fields make for a good sight on these roads.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stopped just before the Nangal-Mehetpur checkpoint (where you need to pay some toll tax to enter Himachal) for a fuel + stretching break.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;&#x2F;images&#x2F;travel&#x2F;hp22&#x2F;3.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;image&quot; &#x2F;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hilly roads finally begin in Una, the main entry point to Himachal when you’re coming from Punjab. The streets are wide enough to enjoy the driving for now, and it’s around 2PM. I wasn’t feeling particularly hungry for a packed lunch, so I kept driving at reasonable speeds and wanted to reach my destination asap. Dharamshala was around 2.5 hours more, and I expected to arrive before 5PM, sleep for a while and only have dinner.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;&#x2F;images&#x2F;travel&#x2F;hp22&#x2F;4.png&quot; alt=&quot;image&quot; &#x2F;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The last ~1 hour or so did test my driving and patience skills. Saturday&#x2F;Sundays are the worst days to visit any hill station in India. Long queues of cars from neighbouring states, all wanting to &lt;em&gt;find peace in hills&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; while blaring horns (the irony).&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;&#x2F;images&#x2F;travel&#x2F;hp22&#x2F;5.png&quot; alt=&quot;image&quot; &#x2F;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was overwhelmed by driving through umpteenth hairpin bends and really steep curves from Dharamshala to Naddi; I was glad I made it safely to the Airbnb.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;&#x2F;images&#x2F;travel&#x2F;hp22&#x2F;9.gif&quot; alt=&quot;image&quot; &#x2F;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;&#x2F;images&#x2F;travel&#x2F;hp22&#x2F;6.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;image&quot; &#x2F;&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;&#x2F;images&#x2F;travel&#x2F;hp22&#x2F;7.png&quot; alt=&quot;image&quot; &#x2F;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After unpacking my bags, I decided to explore the local area for a short while before settling into sleep as it was still evening. I went to Dal Lake; sadly, the lake was all dried up in the scorching heat of May. However, the tall Deodar trees are a pleasing sight and made the 10hr journey completely worth it.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;&#x2F;images&#x2F;travel&#x2F;hp22&#x2F;8.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;image&quot; &#x2F;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Had a quiet dinner and night’s sleep that day. My plan for the next few days was to visit the local areas of Naddi and McleodGanj. Since I was WFHing during the trip, I only had weekends to explore other parts of Kangra valley.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;hr &#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The following day, being a Sunday, meant a lazy brekkie - preferably brunch. I impromptu decided to drive to Palampur and further go up to Bir and Billing valley. I’ve heard a lot about tea estates in Palampur, and the drive was really spectacular.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;&#x2F;images&#x2F;travel&#x2F;hp22&#x2F;10.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;image&quot; &#x2F;&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;&#x2F;images&#x2F;travel&#x2F;hp22&#x2F;11.png&quot; alt=&quot;image&quot; &#x2F;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I didn’t want to drive a lot this day, so I chose to skip Bir and go straight to Billing for brunch. The roads to Billing valley are pretty narrow and crowded, so I decided to park my car in the first open parking lot I found. Two locals approached me and insisted that I pay them 50 bucks for parking without giving me any ticket. I obviously knew it was a scam, but after driving for 2.5 hours and semi hangry, I just gave them the money after resisting. A few steps further in the valley, I found the “proper” govt parking lot. Meh, shit happens. I devoured a nice cheese omelette with some ice tea at one of the local cafes in Billing. There are plenty of food options, and I’ve heard there are good pizzerias. Since I was by myself, I sure couldn’t eat a whole pizza, so I, unfortunately, had to skip it.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Billing had a different vibe to it. I wish I could spend more time here for a few days. Definitely gonna come back again in future and explore Bir as well.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

&lt;hr &#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over the next few days, I roamed around Naddi and gave my car a bit of rest. Luckily I’d visited Mcleod in my car during a weekday, and suffice to say that driving on the weekend inside Mcleod is an activity that is best left unexplored. I tried a Tibetan thali at Tibet Kitchen, a popular eatery in Mcleod and loved Ema Datshi. Laphing was another thing that I loved, despite being hot AF and me being someone who hates spicy food (I make certain exceptions, like Meghana Biryani).&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I frequented Mcleod over the next few days but got acquainted with a friendly Subway guy after getting bored with the local food. Yes, I’m that guy who likes Subway even though it’s somehow a cool thing to hate it, but yeah, whatever. I did try chicken momos from a streetside vendor, and being brutally honest - they were awful. You get better momos than that crap in Delhi. I felt a bit disappointed, but I guess you’ve to make peace that almost all popular&#x2F;touristy destinations have almost everything average. You’ve to set your expectations reasonably at that level.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;hr &#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The following weekend came, and I was excited to drive more in the hills. Somehow my favourite thing about this entire trip was driving. I discovered a lovely cafe in Dharamshala and happily spent half of my day here. Everything was top notch: the food, the vibe, and the people running this cafe. Discovering this place is easily one of the highlights of my trip.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;&#x2F;images&#x2F;travel&#x2F;hp22&#x2F;16.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;image&quot; &#x2F;&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;&#x2F;images&#x2F;travel&#x2F;hp22&#x2F;17.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;image&quot; &#x2F;&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;&#x2F;images&#x2F;travel&#x2F;hp22&#x2F;18.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;image&quot; &#x2F;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next day, I decided to do a few touristy things. I went to War Memorial in Dharamshala. The person at the counter was super shocked to know that I was alone. This place is really well maintained, has plenty of quiet, peaceful spots and a beautiful garden to take a walk-in.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;&#x2F;images&#x2F;travel&#x2F;hp22&#x2F;21.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;image&quot; &#x2F;&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;&#x2F;images&#x2F;travel&#x2F;hp22&#x2F;22.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;image&quot; &#x2F;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Roamed around for a bit and decided to head to Masroor Rock Cut Temple. I’d heard a lot about this from my Airbnb host, and since it was a drive that meant I could explore other parts of the valley, it interested me. The roads in Kangra valley will definitely excite you. The hairpin bends take some time getting used to, but damn, they are fun. Although, something that seems to be the norm in the hills (but was new to me) was that some drivers will turn on the indicators, signalling that you can overtake them from that side. This was obviously confusing initially, but then it’s all about getting used to it.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;&#x2F;images&#x2F;travel&#x2F;hp22&#x2F;23.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;image&quot; &#x2F;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I reached the place and was surprised to see that the ticketing system was entirely online, and there was no cash counter. Scan the code, pay via UPI and enter a temple built in the 8th CE. If this is not a brilliant display of post-modern India, I don’t know what is. Oh, the monolithic rock-cut temple was darn impressive. It was initially a complex of 19 temples; however, only a few remain after the devastating earthquake in 1905 that hit the Kangra valley. Out of the 19 temples, 16 of them were carved out from a single rock!&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I had some delicious Maggi from a stall on my way back, and you’ll find many such on hilly roads. Placebo effect or not, Maggi is best relished in the hills.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;hr &#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After exploring almost all of Naddi, Mcleod, and Dharamshala the following week, I found it boring over the weekdays. My original plan was to stay here for a bit longer, but I decided to cut short my trip and this week being my last week. I visited Andretta Valley, and boy oh boy. This was the most beautiful part of the Kangra valley, just a few km away from Palampur. This small village had all my heart with its tranquil and relaxing vibe. The roads towards Andretta were newly constructed, and I was cruising at 70-80 in the hills. After driving in Mcleod’s busy markets for 2 weeks, I’d almost forgotten that my car’s 5th&#x2F;6th gear also exists. The experience was surreal; I sat here and did nothing, just observing these folks’ slow and peaceful lives. There are no tourists here, and I didn’t particularly find any shops here either. The more I write, the more I want to go back and experience it again.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;&#x2F;images&#x2F;travel&#x2F;hp22&#x2F;27.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;image&quot; &#x2F;&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;&#x2F;images&#x2F;travel&#x2F;hp22&#x2F;28.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;image&quot; &#x2F;&gt;

&lt;img src=&quot;&#x2F;images&#x2F;travel&#x2F;hp22&#x2F;30.png&quot; alt=&quot;image&quot; &#x2F;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;hr &#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And with that beautiful drive, it was time to pack my bags and bid this lovely place a final goodbye. I couldn’t sleep properly at night because I had a weird excitement about going back home, eating home food and sleeping on my familiar bed. I guess 2 weeks of travel does this to you.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I started the journey in the wee hours of the morning, around 4:45, with a laser-sharp focus to just reach asap. Yeah, I don’t like to take a lot of breaks when driving; I know many people prefer it the other way, but for me, even the food breaks shouldn’t take more than 20-30 minutes. Else I feel I wasted a lot of time. An advantage of driving so early was that I could exit Himachal in just three hours or so, which otherwise would have taken 4+ hours because of traffic etc. Also, look at the pretty sunrise somewhere in Kangra! I stopped for a quick brekkie, but in my true essence, instead of having something light, I packed on a nice Chole Bhature and, of course, the tea.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;&#x2F;images&#x2F;travel&#x2F;hp22&#x2F;31.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;image&quot; &#x2F;&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;&#x2F;images&#x2F;travel&#x2F;hp22&#x2F;32.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;image&quot; &#x2F;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cruised along the NH44, reminiscing all the sweet memories of the trip but a euphoric feeling of getting back home. I reached by 2:30 PM, had lunch and fell into a deep slumber.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;hr &#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overall, I had a lot of fun, and yes, some things didn’t go right (in terms of adequately planning beforehand). But, I guess the point of solo trips is not that they’ve to be picture-perfect, but instead, how you deal with situations thrown at you, all by yourself. I skipped visiting a few places I had in mind, I could have planned a better stay where I could meet other fellow travellers, but I don’t regret this trip even a bit. I got to finally drive my car on the hills solo, which gave me a lot of confidence to make much more challenging trips in the future. Hope the hills beckon me soon!&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
